# Simple Shell Project

## Description

This project is a simple UNIX command line interpreter implemented in C. It aims to replicate basic functionalities of the sh shell, providing a hands-on understanding of how shells work, process creation, and command execution in Unix-like operating systems.

## Features

- Displays a prompt "$ " and waits for user input
- Executes simple shell commands
- Handles command lines with arguments
- Implements built-in commands: exit, env, setenv, unsetenv
- Handles the PATH to find executable programs
- Supports interactive and non-interactive modes
- Handles the EOF (End Of File) condition
- Handles the Ctrl + C signal without exiting the shell

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- GCC compiler with flags: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- Follow Betty style guidelines
- No more than 5 functions per file
- All header files should be include guarded
- Use system calls only when necessary

## Compilation

To compile the shell, use the following command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

```bash
./hsh
#cisfun$ /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
#cisfun$ exit
```

### Non-Interactive Mode

```bash
echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
```

## Built-in Commands

- `exit`: Exit the shell
- `env`: Print the current environment
- `setenv`: Set an environment variable
- `unsetenv`: Unset an environment variable

## Files

- `_which.c` Implements the functionality to search for executable files in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable.
- `builtin_execute.c` Contains the logic to execute built-in shell commands.
- `builtins.c` Defines the built-in commands supported by the shell (e.g., exit, env).
- `child.c` Handles the creation and management of child processes for executing external commands.
- `errors.c` Manages error handling and error message display.
- `free.c` Contains functions for memory deallocation and cleanup.
- `getenv.c` Implements custom functions to interact with environment variables.
- `getline.c` Provides a custom implementation of the getline function for reading user input.
- `hsh.c` The main shell loop that reads commands and executes them.
- `main.h` Header file containing function prototypes and necessary includes.
- `prompt.c` Handles the display of the shell prompt.
- `tokenizer.c` Splits the input string into tokens for command processing.
- `utility_functions.c` Contains various utility functions used throughout the shell implementation.

## Key Functions

- `_putchar`: Prints a character
- `_puts`: Prints a string
- `_strlen`: Calculates the length of a string
- `_strdup`: Duplicates a string
- `concat_all`: Concatenates three strings
